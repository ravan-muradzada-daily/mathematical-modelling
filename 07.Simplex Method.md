Simplex method is better version of Table method. This method works similar to table method. So we can use it only to find max value (not min value) and there is no constraint in the number of the decision variables.

### **Steps in Simplex Method**
- We need to add slack variables to each inequalities and get the system of linear equations (the same with Table method). 
- Then we will add a new equation here. If our objective function is: (P = ax1 + bx2), we will convert it to: (P - ax1 - bx2). Then we should add this equation to our system.
- We will create our simplex table (which is matrix).
The system:

Let's create a matrix from this system:
![[matrix_in_simplex_method.png]]As you can see our current P is 0 and that is not max one yet.
To be able to find max P, there must be only nonnegative values in the last row.
Because for x1 and x2 there is no pivot, we can say they are 0. However s1 is pivot, so s1=32 and s2 is pivot, so s2 = 84.

- In the last row, we should find the smallest negative value. From the top part of this column, we will select pivot candidate row. To be able to choose the best one from these elements, we will divide the proper result part to this possible candidate and among these results, we will take the smallest one. That is the correct pivot candidate.
	
> [!warning] Warning!
> Note that, among the possible pivot candidates, the zeros and negative ones cannot be pivot candidates. Only positive ones can become pivot. If among them, there is no positive pivot candidate, that means there is no optimal solution for this problem
