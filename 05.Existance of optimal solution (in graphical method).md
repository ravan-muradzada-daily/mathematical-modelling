There are three theorems which help us to determine whether optimal solution (min or max value) do exists or not.
1) If the solution area from graphical method (feasible area) is bounded by all sides, this problem has both min and max values.
2) If the feasible area is not restricted and the variables in objective functions have positive cooefficients, it has min value, but not max value.
3) If from the graph, feasible area is undefined, there is no solution.
